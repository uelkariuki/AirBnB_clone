						<p>This is a lovely 1 bedroom apartment that can accomodate 2 people. It locates at the center of Shanghai and next to subway line 1. 1 stop to People, 2 stops to Bund, 3 stops to Jingan Temple. Take an early morning stroll and enjoy the Trevi Fountain without the tourists. Wander around the historic streets while the city sleeps, then head back for a morning coffee at this urban-chic studio with a suspended loft bedroom. It is very affordable and its versatility will leave you refreshed.</p>

						Our place is a private, affordable stand-alone guests house centrally located just minutes to French Quarters, downtown the Fair Grounds (Jazz Fest) and City Park. The guest house is a quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen & living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counter area that adds character to the room and a grear porch/ deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.

								<li class="Actual-Review-Text"><p>Fantastic place.It was clean, Adrienne was great(even though we did not meet in person) and everything went super smooth. Location is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p></li>

						Unwind at this stunning French Provencal beachside cottage. The house was lovingly built with stone floors, high-beamed ceilings, and antique details for a luxurious yet charming feel. Enjoy the sea and mountain views from the pool and lush garden. The house is located in the enclave of Llandudno Beach, a locals-only spot with unspoilt, fine white sand and curling surfing waves. Although shops and restaurants are only a five-minute drive away, the area feels peaceful and secluded.

								<li class="Actual-Review-Text"><p>When we first stumbled upon this flat on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. Xavier is the most thoughtful, gracious host.

									He provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The Suite is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs.
									
									The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace are excellent. Location is incredible.
									
									Xavier had excellent restaurant recommendations and was of great help. He went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable.
									
									Thanks Xavier for a wonderful weekend!</p></li>
